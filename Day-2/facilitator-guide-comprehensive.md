## üéØ Facilitation Strategies

### For Implementation-Focused Day:
- **Hands-on priority**: More coding, less talking
- **Pair programming**: Students work together on exercises
- **Live debugging**: Use real errors as teaching moments
- **Celebrate wins**: "Look what you just built!"

### Energy Management:
- **Morning**: High energy with takehome review
- **Mid-morning**: Focus on architecture and structure
- **Afternoon**: Database design excitement
- **Late afternoon**: Authentication implementation
- **End**: Integration satisfaction

### Common Implementation Issues:
- **Docker problems**: "Let's debug this together"
- **Code errors**: "What's the error telling us?"
- **Database confusion**: "Let's draw this out"
