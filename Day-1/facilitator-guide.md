## üéØ Facilitation Strategies

### For 4-Student Groups:
- **Pair activities**: 2 pairs of 2 for focused discussion
- **Round-robin sharing**: Everyone presents in each activity
- **Collaborative boards**: All 4 work on same Excalidraw
- **Friendly competition**: Pairs compete on design challenges
- **Direct questions**: Call on individuals by name

### Energy Management:
- **High energy start**: Jump right into API treasure hunt
- **Post-lunch dip**: Make 1:00 PM highly interactive (REST mapping)
- **End strong**: Legacy challenge is fun and relatable
- **Use timers**: Visible countdown creates urgency
- **Movement**: Don't let them sit for more than 20 minutes

### Common Pitfalls to Address:
- **Over-engineering**: "Keep it simple, add complexity when needed"
- **Technical jargon**: "How would you explain this to a product manager?"
- **Perfect solutions**: "What would break first at scale?"
- **Database thinking**: "APIs should speak business language, not database language"

---

## üó£Ô∏è Discussion Facilitation

### Question Types:
**Open questions**: "What do you think about..."
**Probing questions**: "Why did you choose..."
**Connecting questions**: "How does this relate to..."
**Reality check questions**: "What would happen in production if..."

### When Students Get Stuck:
1. **Reframe the question**: Business perspective vs technical
2. **Give examples**: "Imagine you're explaining to your manager..."
3. **Use analogies**: Physical world comparisons
4. **Pair them up**: Let students teach each other

### Managing Debates:
- **Acknowledge both sides**: "That's a valid perspective..."
- **Find the constraint**: "What would drive you toward one choice?"
- **Real-world context**: "In production, you'd need to consider..."
- **Move forward**: Don't let perfect be the enemy of good

## üìã Assessment & Validation

### During Activities:
**Look for**:
- [ ] Business language in URL designs
- [ ] Correct status code reasoning
- [ ] Domain boundaries that make sense
- [ ] Understanding of protocol trade-offs

**Red flags**:
- [ ] Technical/database language in APIs
- [ ] Generic endpoints like `/getData`
- [ ] Confusion about status code semantics
- [ ] Thinking one protocol is always better

### End of Day Checklist:
**Each student should have**:
- [ ] Clear TaskFlow domain model
- [ ] REST endpoint specifications
- [ ] Error response patterns
- [ ] API type decision framework
- [ ] Legacy integration strategy
- [ ] Forked taskflow-api repository
- [ ] Submitted at least one PR with new endpoint
- [ ] Reviewed at least one peer's PR

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Setup & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
**Postman problems**: Use web version as backup
**Excalidraw access**: Google Drawings as alternative
**API endpoints down**: Have screenshots as backup
**VS Code issues**: Browser dev tools work for GET requests

### Backup Plans:
**No internet**: Printed worksheets for all activities
**Tool failures**: Physical sticky notes and whiteboards
**Demo failures**: Pre-recorded screenshots and videos
**Time pressure**: Skip OpenAPI contract activity if needed

---

## üìä Success Metrics

### Immediate (End of Day 1):
- [ ] Students can explain DDD principles in their own words
- [ ] Can design RESTful endpoints using business language
- [ ] Understand when to choose different API protocols
- [ ] Can handle error scenarios appropriately

### Forward-looking (Setup for Day 2):
- [ ] Students excited about implementation

## üé™ Instructor Energy & Tone

### Maintain High Energy:
- **Enthusiasm for APIs**: "This is the fun part!"
- **Real-world relevance**: "You'll use this next week"
- **Student success focus**: "You're getting it!"
- **Curiosity encouragement**: "Great question!"

### Avoid:
- **Lecturing**: Keep talking segments under 10 minutes
- **Perfectionism**: "Good enough to move forward"
- **Technical showing off**: Stay at their level
- **Rushing**: Better to skip content than rush through it

### Recovery Strategies:
**If behind**: Skip optional discussions, prioritize hands-on
**If ahead**: Deeper dives into student questions
**If energy drops**: Stand up, move around, change format
**If confused**: Stop, reframe, use different approach

**Remember**: You're guiding discovery, not delivering information. Let them figure out the domain boundaries. Let them struggle with status codes. Your job is to facilitate their learning, not to tell them the answers.

**Day 1 Success**: Students leave excited to build TaskFlow APIs and confident in their design decisions.
