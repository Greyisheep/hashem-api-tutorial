# TaskFlow API Course - 5-Day Implementation Guide

🎯 **Core Philosophy**: "Show, Practice, Apply, Scale" - 80% Hands-on, 20% Theory + Real-World Production Context

## Course Overview

This is a comprehensive 5-day API development course focused on building a production-ready **TaskFlow API** (project management system) using Python and FastAPI [[memory:4481488]]. Each day builds upon the previous, creating a complete, deployable API by the end.
