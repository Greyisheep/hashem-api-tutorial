## üéØ Security Score

Calculate your security score:

**Score Calculation:**
- Each completed item: +1 point
- Each incomplete item: 0 points
- Total possible points: 150

**Security Levels:**
- **90-100% (135-150 points)**: Production Ready
- **80-89% (120-134 points)**: Needs Minor Improvements
- **70-79% (105-119 points)**: Needs Significant Improvements
- **Below 70% (<105 points)**: Not Ready for Production

**Your Score: ___ / 150 = ___%**

## üöÄ Next Steps

### If Score < 90%:
1. **Address critical security issues first**
2. **Implement missing security controls**
3. **Re-run security tests**
4. **Re-audit before deployment**

### If Score ‚â• 90%:
1. **Deploy with confidence**
2. **Monitor security metrics**
3. **Schedule regular security reviews**
